In this milestone-51
I got several problems with delimiter, output problem, loop condition

I tried many times for how to instantiate a Contagion Test Patient and Triage Patient
but I did not know how to implement it.
Then I checked the handout and the note about the file of b-dynamicDefaultDerived from 15-Mar21
Base* D = new Derived;

After studied this, and got a reference from this syntax,
I solved one of the problems.

I tried many times about output, and just noticed that I made the wrong order for the read function of temp patient pointer.
I did not know should I use lineup or temp patient pointer to read the patient information from the file.
And checked if I used lineup to read file, I would get BAD ACCESS,
therefore, I used temp patient pointer to read the information from the file.

For the big problem of this milestone-51, delimiter,
I checked the instruction many times that if I made wrong with the any file import,
however, everything was not wrong about that.
So I changed the way to check the delimiters,
I found that I used many ignore(1000, ',') and ignore(1000, '\n')
After that I made them all with ignore() or deleted them,
I checked the output did it match the correct output,
and yes, I got them right.
