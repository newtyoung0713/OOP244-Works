In this workshop, I struggling with how to print the whole graph well.
To begin with, I read how to use many functions from Github, 
and knowing I have to use readMarks to get the data by fscanf.
Then store the data into structure array, and assign them to integer variable.
Using printGraph function with three parameters for the whole graph.
I got reference from Github about bubble sort, and made changing for the variable name,
and made it as an independent function in StMark.cpp.
Moreover, I declared two integers and one StMark structure to swap temporarily,
if the next mark is greater than the previous one.
Using the temporary one to store the previous one I want to swap,
and assign the next one to the previous one,
then assign the temporary one back to the next one.

In addition, I studied how to use many functions for modifying the printGraph function properly.
I read how to use the function printBar to print asterisks in the graph.
Then read printInt from io.cpp to print the number and the space in the graph, 
and tried to group up the student mark into ten groups,
I used the basic version first with:
for (i = 0; i < noOfSamples; i++) {
  if (samples[i] > 90 && samples[i] <= 100) markGroup[9]++;
  else if (samples[i] > 80) markGroup[8]++;
  else if (samples[i] > 70) markGroup[7]++;
  else if (samples[i] > 60) markGroup[6]++;
  else if (samples[i] > 50) markGroup[5]++;
  else if (samples[i] > 40) markGroup[4]++;
  else if (samples[i] > 30) markGroup[3]++;
  else if (samples[i] > 20) markGroup[2]++;
  else if (samples[i] > 10) markGroup[1]++;
  else markGroup[0]++;
}
then tried to make it simple, so I used the version with for nesting.
After grouping up, I tried to output the main part for me, the graph.

Furthermore, I could print everything out, but asterisks, the pipe line sign and the boundaries.
Therefore, I tried to change the number for labelLine and line first.
Then got reference to print each group with width of 4 by printInt.
After everything done,
I stuck at how to print asterisks in correct way.
I always got less asterisks with group1.csv
Then when I tested group3.csv
I realized that the for nesting had a bug with collection,
consequently, I wrote one more condition for if j equals to 1 and samples[i] equals to and greater than 0.
I did a math about 40 = 65 * 61 / max, 52 = 65 * 78 / max,
However, I got different numbers about the formula from barlength.
So when I got max equals to 100, I tried the number of max from 100 to the correct number one on one.
Since I got the max should be MAX - 3 for group3.csv.
But, how if I have to test the file with group1.csv not group3.csv,
therefore, I calculated the same formula for group1.csv,
then I got with 65, so I used GRAPH_WIDTH as the parameter.
After the calculation, I tested with group1 and group3.csv again,
and I got the result was the same as Github showed me.
