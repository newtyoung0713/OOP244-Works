In this workshop-8
I learned how to use "protected",
it helped me to access the member variable from different cpp file,
then I can access the variable for implementation this workshop.

Because of SavingsAccount and ChequingAccount all based on Account,
therefore, after I set the member variable, m_curBalance, in the protected,
while I was coding SavingsAccount.cpp and ChequingAccount.cpp,
I did not need to worry do I need to implement setter as before,
and I just use it with no doubt.

However, before I done with the workshop
that I stuck at the instructions for a while because I was confused,
and I did not realized 
that I had to make the current balance in the protected.
And was thinking about how to make setter in Utils.cpp and Utils.h.

Furthermore, when I knew the current balance should be in the protected,
and used google translator, I made this workshop successfully.

After I finished this workshop,
I tried my best to simple my code as I can.
such as return true or false without a bool variable.
