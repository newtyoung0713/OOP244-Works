For this workshop-6
I faced a few problems
1. I did not know how to print everything out well,
   until I made the loadEmails function.
2. I did not know how to import and export files,
   until I saw the function of setNoOfEmails.
3. I searched how to implement making data(s) into a dynamic array,
   then review the functions in the class of Email,
   just knew I could use the load function to get it.

However, before I got the right output, I faced many problems,
so I step by step to try every single problem.
Also, I checked is any prototype that I made wrong way.
And trying to make sure the code are right with the output.

I think I am still not familiar with some concepts, and English as well.
Because I need to use translator to help me understanding what the introduction means,
then I just can do it properly that the author wants.
