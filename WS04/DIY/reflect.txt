In this workshop that we started to use constructors and destructors.
Therefore we can just use constructor to initial the object, some types and assign values,
then uses the destructor to free the dynamic memory
that avoids memory leak problem in the end of the whole program.

Furthermore, followed the instructions from Github of OOP-Workshops,
Everything was just got more practicing chances to me.
However, the difficult part for me was English problem,
sometimes was kind of hard to understand the words from the instructions,
so I used Google translate to help me understanding it easier.
But, I was still trying to understand in English.

In addition, I found there is something about free dynamic memory before the end of the program,
so I used that function to clean the data and to free them.
Then I used the function in other function,
and I do not need to type the same codes in other function once again.
That was save my time to type the codes,
and could make the program easier to understand.

By practicing from each workshop,
I got more understanding about dynamic memory, constructor, destructor, and encapsulation.
