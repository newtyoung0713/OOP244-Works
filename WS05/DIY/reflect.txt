In this workshop
For the first part, I was confused some of instructions.
I could not be sure why we should consider if their difference is less than 0.001.
Also, I was struggling with how to implement the operators about these:
++, -=, ==, <<, and >
However, I tried many times with = or += for the operator++,
how should I multiplied by -1 for the specified value,
how to compare three values are identical,
how to make sure for the increasing and decreasing the funds properly,
and how to make the lhs and rhs casting correct.
After many hours,
I found how to make them well.

For the second part,
I stuck with how to set up power level well.
At the end, even only used twice, I still made a function for it.
However, I still had problem with the operator, one of them, operator+=.
Therefore I found a way to make it well,
like copy the original object to the new one,
deleted the old one for preparing to get new data,
then assigned new data after the old data,
finally to assign the whole new data to the original object.
at the end, I had no idea how to make the prototype about the functions.
However, I remembered we learned a keyword about how to access another class, that is by FRIENDSHIP.
So I made four friendships for the functions to make sure
that I could use data member from different classes,
and because of these four functions had the keyword friend,
I had to declare them in the class.
