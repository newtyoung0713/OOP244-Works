For this workshop-9
I think we focus on rule of three,
and more about copy constructor and copy assignment operator.

At the beginning, I think I know what are the rule of three in OOP.
However, I did this workshop and I did not know that much about rule of three.
First of all, I think I did the class of LibraryItem well,
and I would do the class of Book okay as well.
When I ran the program and got the output,
I failed with the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator parts,
then I checked for the whole program for it.
Moreover, I used Xcode to debug this workshop
and I did not find any problem for the output.

In addition, I checked the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator again,
and just realized I got the problem in the class of Book,
not had a problem in the class of the LibraryItem.
Furthermore, I initialized the LibraryItem on the initializer list of the copy constructor of Book,
and invoked the copy assignment operator of LibraryItem 
in the copy assignment operator of Book.
Then I got the correct output for this workshop.

Furthermore, I checked the concept about this problem.
I got if we invoked LibraryItem on Book's copy constructor,
I could make it sure that copy book's attribute to LibraryItem,
and it's similar idea for copy assignment operator for Book.
Invoking the copy assignment operator of LibraryItem inside of Book,
to make sure the compiler can assign the value to LibraryItem,
then the program can handle the value well and go through the whole program.
